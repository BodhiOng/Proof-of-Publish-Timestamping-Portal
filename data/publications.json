We demonstrate how content can be timestamped and verified\nwithout revealing the content itself.\n\nIntroduction:\nContent authenticity and timestamping have become critical issues in the digital age.\nTraditional methods rely on centralized authorities, which introduce single points of\nfailure and trust requirements.\n\nMethodology:\nOur approach uses SHA-256 hashing combined with Ethereum smart contracts to create\nimmutable records of content publication. The system preserves privacy by storing only\nhashes on-chain while maintaining verifiability.\n\nResults:\nIn our experiments, we achieved 100% verification accuracy with average gas costs of\n21,000 gwei per publication.",
